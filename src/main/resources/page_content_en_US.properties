D_profile.txt=A taxi driver driving on a busy motorway Before you do anything else, focus on one thing: licensing. Stay on the right side of the law and ensure all taxis in your fleet are licensed. Customers are unlikely to opt for your cab service if the vehicles lack licenses, as they?ll feel less secure. Make sure all fleet vehicles have their licenses prominently displayed, as this will reassure potential passengers that they?re in safe hands. Next, find dependable taxi fleet insurance cover, suited to your specific needs. Accidents, theft, vandalism, and damage all pose risks to your business investment: your vehicles. You also want to make sure your drivers are covered in the event of an accident or incident in the cab..

common.about.save=Seven Reasons Why Taxis Are The Best Transport Option
common.about.world= The world is progressing at a speed that is becoming increasingly difficult to catch up with, and so is the advancement in the different means of transport that are being made available for the public to be used.With so many new transport options it is quite apparent that people now days have a hard time deciding which transport would best suit their traveling needs.Although many companies have evolved providing you transportation, however, no vehicle can compete with the traditional taxis that we have always been using To make your decision even less stressful, we have compiled seven reasons that prove beyond any doubt that even in this century taxis are the best transport option available to you.
common.about.why=The easiest option:
common.about.if=If you are in a hurry to catch a flight at the airport or you don?t want to miss your meeting at work, then you can easily spot any taxi on the road that will take you to your destination without any further procedures.You don?t have to deal with calling them and scheduling a ride and then waiting forever for transport that never seems to arrive. Although taxis nowadays also have the advanced service of letting you book a ride beforehand, but that is only when you need to schedule a trip for an event that is not an emergency situation.
common.about.it=It is strikingly cheap
common.about.is= Traveling in taxis is remarkably affordable especially when you have to make it to the airport. Going for a cheap taxi ride is so much more convenient than driving yourself to different places and going through the hassle of finding the right place to park your car.A stress-free and comfortable ride in the taxi not only saves the fuel of your transport but also saves up your driving energy too.
common.about.tit1=It is always available:
common.about.txt1=Most public transports have a particular time during which they are available. The disadvantage to this is that many vehicles are not available during the late hours when you are mainly in a desperate need of a ride.However, you don?t have to face these problems when you are a regular taxi user as taxis are always available to the public throughout the entire day, late hours of the night and early morning too.Although sometimes taxis can be a little overcharging, however, they do you the favor of helping you reach home safely no matter how late at night it is. Safety first:Safety is something that you can be utterly secured about whenever you are traveling in a licensed taxi.This also means that you can plan late night rides, where your night will start and end in the safest way possible.You can gulp down as many glasses of drink as you want without fearing the fact that you might not be stable enough to make it home, as the taxi drivers are responsible enough to drop you back without letting you face any inconveniences.
common.about.tit2=A comfortable and stress free ride:
common.about.txt2= Unlike the discomfort you have to face while traveling in a bus or a train, moving in a taxi has the advantage of giving you a peaceful and the most comfortable ride that sucks all the stress and exhaustion of the day out of you. Having a hard day at work and then giving yourself a further headache of driving yourself home by your transport is definitely not a very wise option. Instead, enjoying a relaxed and pleasant ride in a taxi to your home sounds like the better option of the two!
common.about.tit3= A personal ride all to yourself:
common.about.txt3= Public transport can be a real hassle especially when you are looking forward to enjoying your drive home with some personal space and comfort.Public trains and buses can be crowded especially during the peak hours when everyone is looking forward to going home.A taxi is not only very useful when you want to enjoy a ride all on your own, but it also helps you to personally communicate with the driver and give him instructions about the exact location where you want to be dropped.This option would not have been possible when traveling via another public transport.
common.about.tit4=Easy with the luggage:
common.about.txt4= No other transport cooperates with you as much as the taxi drivers do to help you with your entire luggage that is safely loaded into the taxi and transported to the place where you are heading, making taxis the best transport that you can utilize.
