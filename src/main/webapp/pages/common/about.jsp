    <h3><h1>Seven Reasons Why Taxis Are The Best Transport Option</h1><br><h4>

        The world is progressing at a speed that is becoming increasingly difficult to catch up with, and so is the
        advancement in the different means of transport that are being made available for the public to be used.

        With so many new transport options it is quite apparent that people now days have a hard time deciding which
        transport would best suit their traveling needs.

        Although many companies have evolved providing you transportation, however, no vehicle can compete with the
        traditional taxis that we have always been using.

        To make your decision even less stressful, we have compiled seven reasons that prove beyond any doubt that even
        in this century taxis are the best transport option available to you.</h4>

        <h1>The easiest option:</h1><br><h4>
            If you are in a hurry to catch a flight at the airport or you don’t want to miss your meeting at work, then
            you can easily spot any taxi on the road that will take you to your destination without any further
            procedures.

            You don’t have to deal with calling them and scheduling a ride and then waiting forever for transport that
            never seems to arrive. Although taxis nowadays also have the advanced service of letting you book a ride
            beforehand, but that is only when you need to schedule a trip for an event that is not an emergency
            situation.
        </h4>
        <h1>It is strikingly cheap:</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Traveling in taxis is remarkably affordable especially when you have to make it to the airport. Going for a
            cheap taxi ride is so much more convenient than driving yourself to different places and going through the
            hassle of finding the right place to park your car.

            A stress-free and comfortable ride in the taxi not only saves the fuel of your transport but also saves up
            your driving energy too.
        </h4>
        <h1>It is always available:</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Most public transports have a particular time during which they are available. The disadvantage to this is
            that many vehicles are not available during the late hours when you are mainly in a desperate need of a
            ride.

            However, you don’t have to face these problems when you are a regular taxi user as taxis are always
            available to the public throughout the entire day, late hours of the night and early morning too.

            Although sometimes taxis can be a little overcharging, however, they do you the favor of helping you reach
            home safely no matter how late at night it is.

            Safety first:
            Safety is something that you can be utterly secured about whenever you are traveling in a licensed taxi.
            This also means that you can plan late night rides, where your night will start and end in the safest way
            possible.

            You can gulp down as many glasses of drink as you want without fearing the fact that you might not be stable
            enough to make it home, as the taxi drivers are responsible enough to drop you back without letting you face
            any inconveniences.
        </h4>
        <h1> A comfortable and stress free ride:</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Unlike the discomfort you have to face while traveling in a bus or a train, moving in a taxi has the
            advantage of giving you a peaceful and the most comfortable ride that sucks all the stress and exhaustion of
            the day out of you.

            Having a hard day at work and then giving yourself a further headache of driving yourself home by your
            transport is definitely not a very wise option. Instead, enjoying a relaxed and pleasant ride in a taxi to
            your home sounds like the better option of the two!
        </h4>
        <h1> A personal ride all to yourself:</h1><br>
        <h4>
            Public transport can be a real hassle especially when you are looking forward to enjoying your drive home
            with some personal space and comfort.

            Public trains and buses can be crowded especially during the peak hours when everyone is looking forward to
            going home.

            A taxi is not only very useful when you want to enjoy a ride all on your own, but it also helps you to
            personally communicate with the driver and give him instructions about the exact location where you want to
            be dropped.

            This option would not have been possible when traveling via another public transport.
        </h4>
        <h1>Easy with the luggage:</h1><br>
        <h4>
            No other transport cooperates with you as much as the taxi drivers do to help you with your entire luggage
            that is safely loaded into the taxi and transported to the place where you are heading, making taxis the
            best transport that you can utilize.</h3>
